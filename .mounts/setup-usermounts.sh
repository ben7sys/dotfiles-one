# Description:
# This script links the directories .config, .mounts, and .ssh from the dotfiles repository
# to the user's home directory. Then, a systemd service is registered and started
# to configure and start the NFS mounts defined in the .conf file.
# Each directory and file, including hidden files, within the target directories is recursively linked.
# Example: ./dotfiles/.mounts/.conf is linked to ~/.mounts/.conf
# Afterwards, the NFS mounts defined in .mounts/.conf are configured and started.
